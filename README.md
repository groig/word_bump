# Word Bump ðŸ”¥

Ever wondered who else around you is thinking about the same random word? Word Bump is here to help you find out!

## What's this about?

Word Bump is a fun little app that connects people who happen to be thinking about the same word and are close to each other. It's like Tinder, but for words and way less awkward.

Here's how it works:
- You enter a word (any word!)
- The app grabs your location (with your permission, of course)
- It looks for other people nearby who entered the same word
- If there's a match, you can request to connect
- If they accept, you both get to see each other's location

Perfect for finding that person who's also obsessing over "pizza" at 2 AM or wondering about "existentialism" on a Tuesday.

## Tech Stack

Built with Phoenix LiveView because real-time is the only way to live:
- **Phoenix LiveView** - For that sweet real-time magic
- **Phoenix Presence** - Tracks who's around and what they're thinking
- **DaisyUI** - Makes it look pretty without the CSS headache
- **Geolocation API** - Finds where you are (approximately)
- **localStorage** - Remembers your word because nobody wants to retype "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

## Getting Started

2. Clone this repo
3. Install dependencies: `mix deps.get`
4. Install JS dependencies: `npm install --prefix assets`
